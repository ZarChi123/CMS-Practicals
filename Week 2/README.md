Welcome to the overview of my website, developed for the second practical assignment in the Content Management System course at James Cook University Singapore.
In Week 1, I created an initial website focused on curating skincare for teenagers and young adults, tailored primarily for younger users. You can explore the [initial website from Week 1 here](https://skincarebyzarchiiiiioo.on.drv.tw/www.coconutskincarebyzar.com/). However,this project focuses on creating a website tailored for an audience of older individuals, emphasizing user-friendliness and accessibility.
Join me as we delve into the detailed content and explore the specific S.M.A.R.T. goals guiding the development of this site using Joomla,a popular CMS tool.

The primary goal of this Week 2 project is to cater to the interests and needs of older individuals. The skincare website will feature:

1. **Insights into Health and Wellness:** Providing valuable resources related to skincare, health, and overall well-being.
   
2. **Recreational Activities:** Highlighting activities suitable for older individuals, promoting a holistic approach to skincare.

### User-Centric Approach

To ensure relatability, articles within the website will be presented from the viewpoint of older individuals. This approach aims to create a connection and resonate with the target audience.

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals

## Learning Journey for Week 2

For Week 2's assignment, I chose to create a tour website, building upon the experience from Week 1. However, the focus shifted to cater to an older audience, adopting a blog-like format with detailed articles rather than a modern website layout.

## Development Approach

To meet the requirements of the assignment, Joomla was chosen as the Content Management System (CMS). The learning process involved:

1. **Joomla Familiarization:** I delved into the functionalities and features of Joomla to understand how it aligns with the project's objectives.

2. **LinkedIn Learning:** Leveraging LinkedIn Learning resources provided insights into the nuances of Joomla, offering practical guidance on its usage in real-world scenarios. [LinkedIn Learning Joomla Tutorial](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/joomla-4-essential-training)

3. **YouTube Tutorials:** Exploring tutorials on YouTube provided additional perspectives and tips on utilizing Joomla effectively for web development. [YouTube Joomla Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5VZwTLdgdM&list=PLQSbA0rrCrqHZxODzTYgAaCp_zYI3Aiug&index=2).

By combining these resources, I aimed to build a Joomla-based tour website tailored to the preferences and expectations of an older audience.
