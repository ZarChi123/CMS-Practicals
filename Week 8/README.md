Throughout this week, our team is actively engaged in the development of a website dedicated to the James Cook University open house, a pivotal component of our group projects. Our primary emphasis is on delineating a meticulous workflow, underscoring its pivotal role in the successful deployment of web projects. The significance of a well-defined workflow in the creation of a website spans across multiple dimensions, encompassing efficiency, collaborative efforts, quality assurance, consistency, client satisfaction, adaptability, time and cost management, documentation, scalability, and security.

# Group Details
 
Our group name is Team 6. There are four members in our team who are as follows:
1. [Myat Pwint Phyu (14318723)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/myat-pwint-phyu-67b587284/)
2. [Kaung Sat Paing (14399033)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaung-sat-paing-2b02b825b/?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app)
3. [Zar Chi Oo (14211290)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zarchioo/)
4. [Shwe Moe Thant (14228423)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwe-moe-thant-454473223/)


As a team, we set [our code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDKkVeRaLh9u8EgRC4VUBGRNnzZF26KD7whVBtHkiJ8/edit?usp=sharing) for our team.
We also try to do [daily meetings](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/OU00RWc1eENZeWJUbnd0aktVVmlBeVhWZERtcWIwVUo2azM3Y3R4ekZEZjVNbnpsUHRjZE1POUUzQTdnS25xYnwzNDU4NzY0NTQxOTQyODkzMzQwfDI=?share_link_id=231631393104), which is inspired from SCRUM process.

# Project Links
 
As a team, we highly value the project management. Here are the links where you can see our step-by-step version controls
to create a website as team:
1. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShweMoeThantAurum/ContentManagementSystemGroupAssignmentTeam6)
2. [Trello](https://trello.com/b/K4nnWSkQ/team-6)
3. [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/namethegroup/shared_invite/zt-29hsfnftw-c_owSNMwG86oE4wNrx7dtQ)

Our team selected GitHub and its workflow for the James Cook University open house website due to its unparalleled collaboration features, efficiency in code management, real-time updates fostering transparency, skill development opportunities aligned with industry standards, and user-friendly tools like branching, commits, pull requests, issues, and documentation, ensuring a streamlined and effective development process.

To make the most of our chosen workflow, team members are encouraged to follow these steps:

1. Branching: Create a new branch for each feature or task.
2. Commits: Make concise, descriptive commits for better tracking.
3. Pull Requests: Use pull requests for code reviews and discussion.
4. Issues: Report and discuss bugs or propose new features through GitHub issues.
5. Documentation: Keep project documentation updated on the repository for clarity.
 

## Learning Activities & Resources

Before embarking on the development of our Open House website as a team, we conducted a Collaborative Coding Workflow Simulation to ensure seamless coordination, clear roles, and effective communication within the development team. The simulation aimed to mirror the actual coding environment, identifying potential challenges and streamlining our collaborative efforts.We are a team of 5 and all of our learning experiment are recorded below:

### Procedure:

1. Role Assignments: Team members were assigned specific roles, such as frontend developer, backend developer, and project manager, to mimic real-world scenarios.
2. Version Control Exercise: A practical exercise using version control systems (Git and GitHub) was conducted, emphasizing branching, merging, and conflict resolution.
3. Communication Protocols: The team practiced using communication tools like Slack for real-time collaboration, sharing updates, and addressing issues.
4. Coding Challenges: Simulated coding challenges were introduced to test the team's problem-solving abilities, requiring effective collaboration and coordination.

### Zar Chi Oo's Learning Experiment:

**Theory:**
I hypothesize that incorporating short breaks during learning sessions will improve overall retention and understanding.

**Test:**
1. Design a study schedule with 25-minute focused learning sessions followed by a 5-minute break.
2. Implement this schedule for a week during regular study hours.
3. Track the retention and comprehension levels for subjects studied during this period.

### Shwe Moe Thant's Learning Experiment:

**Theory:**
I believe that teaching concepts to others enhances personal understanding and mastery of the subject.

**Test:**
1. Select a complex topic studied during the week.
2. Prepare a brief teaching session for the team, explaining the chosen topic.
3. Evaluate personal understanding and confidence levels before and after the teaching session.

### Kaung Sat Paing's Learning Experiment:

**Theory:**
I suspect that using mnemonic devices can aid in remembering complex coding syntax.

**Test:**
1. Choose a programming language concept with intricate syntax.
2. Develop mnemonic devices to remember key syntax elements.
3. Assess the ability to recall syntax after a week of using mnemonic devices.

### Myat Pwint Phyu's Learning Experiment:

**Theory:**
I posit that incorporating visual aids in note-taking improves information retention.

**Test:**
1. Utilize visual elements such as mind maps and diagrams while taking notes for one subject.
2. Review the visual notes before assessments.
3. Compare retention rates and test scores with traditional text-based note-taking.


## Estimated Hours
 It took approximately more than 3.5 weeks to fully complete our project and get the finished open house website.
