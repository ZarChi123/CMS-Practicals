### Content Insights

The alterations in the website's style extended beyond mere color and size adjustments. Each specific tweak was implemented with the goal of enriching the user's experience. Thicker underlines and vibrant hover colors were introduced to accentuate key attractions, creating a more engaging navigation experience. The decision to increase text size 
and incorporate calming blue hues aimed to draw attention to essential details. 
Consistent, lively link colors were strategically employed as markers to ensure a seamless flow.
The introduction of a soft, light gray background subtly enhanced the entire experience without overshadowing the content.
These changes align with my dedication to crafting an enticing platform that reflects careful consideration and user-centric design.


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Throughout the journey of refining my website's style, I've made adjustments to the CSS following tutorials on w3schools. While my current career trajectory may not heavily emphasize front-end or back-end development intricacies, the exposure to these concepts has significantly expanded my comprehension of website design. Despite these aspects not being my primary focus, the hands-on experience of changing and testing my own website has been the primary source of my learning. This practical engagement has not only enriched my skill set but also contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the website deployment process.
