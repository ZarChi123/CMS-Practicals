## Learning Journey for Week 3

For the third week's practical, I decided to develop a health and wellness centered website, drawing inspiration from the insights gained in the learning resources. However, I made a strategic shift to tailor the content to a diverse audience, including every age group and busy individuals struggling with chaotic diets and in need of physical activities. The approach now leans towards a blog-like format, presenting in-depth articles rather than a contemporary website layout. This adjustment aims to make the content more accessible and relatable to a wider range of individuals seeking guidance in improving their well-being amidst busy lifestyles and dietary challenges.This is acheived using Wordpress.

# Development Approach

To fulfill the requirements of the assignment, I chose WordPress as the Content Management System (CMS) for the development of the tour website. The development process comprised the following steps:

1. **WordPress Familiarization:**
   - Immersed myself in understanding the functionalities and features of WordPress to ensure alignment with the project's objectives.

2. **LinkedIn Learning:**
   - Utilized LinkedIn Learning resources to gain valuable insights into the intricacies of WordPress. The tutorial [LinkedIn Learning WordPress Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-essential-training-22616273/getting-started-with-wordpress?u=2223545) provided practical guidance for real-world application.

3. **YouTube Tutorials:**
   - Explored YouTube tutorials to gain additional perspectives and tips on effectively utilizing WordPress for web development. You can find one of the tutorials [here](https://youtu.be/sOYXRg1m5VQ?si=T0Ws0QkHUlozSC2M).

Taking the necessary time to acclimate to the WordPress interface, the goal was to create a user-friendly and engaging tour website tailored to the preferences and expectations of an older audience.

# Estimated Hours

Starting from the evening of 8/12/2023, I dedicated time to learning Wordpress through LinkedIn and YouTube tutorials. Once I familiarized myself with Wordpress's interface and tools, I initiated the website development process, as outlined earlier. The development spanned approximately one and a half days.

While the duration may seem relatively long, the learning activities for Week 3 consumed a total of around two and a half days. However, given the depth and breadth of Wordpress's features, I wish I had more time to explore further and enhance my website even more.

For Week 3's project, my focus shifted to the creation of  health and wellness website aims to provide a comprehensive platform catering to a diverse audience, offering in-depth articles on holistic wellness, tutorials for various yoga practices, nutritious recipes, and fitness routines tailored for busy individuals. Mindfulness and stress reduction techniques, community stories, and weekly challenges foster a supportive environment. Exclusive member resources, expert Q&A sessions, interactive forums, and a calendar of wellness events enhance community engagement. The website's content strategy focuses on delivering valuable insights, practical tips, and a sense of community to promote a balanced and healthier lifestyle.

##Group Formation

To assemble a capable learning team in anticipation of the upcoming assignment (Assignment 2), I took the initiative to conduct a systematic formation process. Adopting a 'job interview style,' I conducted brief interviews with each classmate, employing targeted questions to understand their working styles, availability, diligence, and shared expectations for group collaboration. Exploring their approaches to task management, collaborative methodologies, and past experiences in group settings yielded valuable insights into their compatibility with our team. Within these discussions, four individuals emerged who demonstrated:

-Myat Pwint Phyu (14318723)
-Kaung Sat Paing (14399033)
-Shin Thant Aung (14191080)
-Shwe Moe Thant (14228423)

Emerged from the selection process were individuals whose attributes strongly resonated with our collective objectives. These team members not only exhibited proficiency in their working styles but also showcased a remarkable commitment to collaborative efforts. Through the interviews, I gained an understanding of their strong problem-solving skills and creativity, which I recognized as valuable assets for our assignment. Their demonstrated dedication, proactive approach to problem-solving, and clear alignment of expectations set them apart from other candidates. It became evident that their values and work ethics harmoniously aligned with our vision for the assignment. By strategically choosing these members, I envisioned a team that not only boasts diverse skills but also fosters a cohesive environment primed for successful collaboration.
