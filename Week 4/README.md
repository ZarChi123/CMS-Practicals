Week 4 centers around advanced configuration and troubleshooting, guiding participants through:
Exploring nuanced WordPress settings and customization options.
Addressing and resolving common issues in XAMPP, WordPress, and PHPMyAdmin.

### Learning Journey for Week 4

In Week 4 of our learning journey, we tackled the practical aspects of creating a dynamic localhost website with a database. The process involved the installation of XAMPP, a crucial cross-platform application for database creation. However, this journey was not without its challenges, particularly on a MacBook with stringent security settings. Adjustments were necessary to overcome these hurdles and successfully deploy a localhost website.

# Installation Challenges
During the installation of XAMPP, I encountered issues on my MacBook, where security and privacy concerns initially restricted the installation of this developer tool. After resolving these issues, another obstacle surfaced: only the Apache and ProFTPD servers could run, while the MySQL database server faced complications. Investigation revealed a pre-existing MySQL server from a previous database modeling course.

# Troubleshooting
To address the MySQL server conflict, I used the MacBook's Activity Monitor, equivalent to Windows' Services, to terminate the conflicting server. This allowed the XAMPP MySQL server to function seamlessly, paving the way for the next steps in deploying our localhost website.

# WordPress Deployment
The deployment of WordPress involved downloading and extracting a zipped package into the "wordpress" folder under "htdocs" in the "xamppfiles" directory. Following step-by-step instructions on Chrome, I successfully created and deployed the localhost website.

# Database Creation
Simultaneously, I utilized "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/" to access the PHPMyAdmin interface and create a database integral to the website. This step was crucial for the proper functioning of the localhost website.

# Learning Resources
Throughout this process, a YouTube video served as a valuable troubleshooting resource, providing practical insights crucial for navigating and resolving issues. [Watch the troubleshooting video here](https://youtu.be/UJ4YMxAFlz4?si=IoZR_zlIyeT0qMQh).
This reflective overview captures the learning journey of Week 1, emphasizing not just the completion of tasks but the skills and insights gained along the way.

Through the designated YouTube video  I  gain practical insights, troubleshooting tips, and a deeper understanding of the concept of localhost and its significance in web development.

### Estimated  Hours

By looking at the lecturer's guide and the practical demo from the youtube video, it was much easier to complete the practical and took around 2 hours to finish the complete setup.
