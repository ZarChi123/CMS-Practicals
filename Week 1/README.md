# Skincare E-commerce Website Project

## Project Overview

I have always been passionate about skincare and envisioned creating a skincare e-commerce website to showcase the products I love. To initiate this project, I explored various themes for inspiration and translated my vision into a tangible concept through detailed sketches using Figma.

## Development Process

The journey from concept to reality involved a gradual transition into coding. Leveraging online resources, I found valuable guidance from [YouTube tutorials](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&pp=ygUbaHRtbCB0dXRvcmlhbCBmb3IgYmVnaW5uZXJz), providing practical insights into web development. Additionally, I referred to the comprehensive tutorials on the [w3schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) for a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS.

Moreover, the lecture notes from [James Cook University's Web Design and Development subject](https://learn.jcu.edu.au/ultra/courses/_168839_1/outline) served as a valuable reference, offering academic perspectives to complement my practical learning.
