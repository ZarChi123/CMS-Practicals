# Learning Activities & Resources



## Project Overview

I have always been passionate about skincare and envisioned creating a skincare e-commerce website to showcase the products I love. To initiate this project, I explored various themes for inspiration and translated my vision into a tangible concept through detailed sketches using Figma.

## Development Process

The journey from concept to reality involved a gradual transition into coding. Leveraging online resources, I found valuable guidance from [YouTube tutorials](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&pp=ygUbaHRtbCB0dXRvcmlhbCBmb3IgYmVnaW5uZXJz), providing practical insights into web development. Additionally, I referred to the comprehensive tutorials on the [w3schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) for a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS.

Moreover, the lecture notes from [James Cook University's Web Design and Development subject](https://learn.jcu.edu.au/ultra/courses/_168839_1/outline) served as a valuable reference, offering academic perspectives to complement my practical learning.

## Resources

- [YouTube Tutorial: Web Development](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&pp=ygUbaHRtbCB0dXRvcmlhbCBmb3IgYmVnaW5uZXJz)
- [w3schools: HTML and CSS Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [James Cook University - Web Design and Development Subject](https://learn.jcu.edu.au/ultra/courses/_168839_1/outline)

This combination of self-exploration, online tutorials, and academic resources has been instrumental in shaping the initial stages of my skincare e-commerce website.




### Estimated Hours and Project Progress

### Day 1: HTML Template and CSS Theme

The first day primarily focused on translating my Figma sketch into a structured HTML template and deciding on the CSS theme for my skincare e-commerce website. While this phase allowed me to lay the foundation for the project, I encountered challenges in managing my time effectively, especially during error resolution.

### Day 2: Error Resolution and Time Management

The subsequent day was dedicated to addressing the errors encountered during the HTML and CSS implementation. Managing time efficiently became crucial in ensuring the completion of the practical. Despite the initial difficulties, I successfully navigated through the challenges and completed the project on time.

##  Content Insights

- **Time Management:** The experience highlighted the importance of effective time management, especially in the context of error resolution and troubleshooting.
- **Problem-Solving:** Overcoming challenges during the coding process provided valuable insights into effective problem-solving in web development.

This reflective overview captures the learning journey of Week 1, emphasizing not just the completion of tasks but the skills and insights gained along the way.
